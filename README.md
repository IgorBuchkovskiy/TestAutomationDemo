# TestAutomationDemo
This is very short automation project just for DEMO purposes

Here are the steps covered in this DEMO:
1) open www.autoplius.lt
2) choose make Audi
3) choose model A6
4) enter 'geras' in text search
5) click on button search
6) check how many results are showed and show the result in console
7) assert if 'Audi A6' is included in search criteria. P.S. This assertion passes
8) assert if 'geras' is in included in search criteria. P.S. This assertion intentionally fails - just to see how it looks when it fails.
9) browser is closed.

Technologies used: Java, junit, selenium
